# # Data Science Tools and Ecosystem

# ## In this notebook, Data Science Tools and Ecosystem are summarized.

# ## Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:
# 
# 1. **Python:** Widely favored for its simplicity, extensive libraries (such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn), and versatility in data analysis, machine learning, and visualization.
# 
# 2. **R:** Known for its statistical analysis capabilities and extensive packages like ggplot2, dplyr, and tidyr. It's commonly used in academia and research.
# 
# 3. **SQL:** Essential for working with databases, SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to retrieve, manipulate, and manage data stored in relational databases.
# 
# 4. **Julia:** Gaining traction due to its high-performance computing capabilities and syntax similar to Python and R. It's suitable for numerical and scientific computing.
# 
# 5. **Scala:** Popular for big data processing with frameworks like Apache Spark due to its scalability and compatibility with Java.
# 
# 6. **JavaScript (with libraries like TensorFlow.js):** For web-based visualizations, building interactive dashboards, and recently, for machine learning applications using TensorFlow.js.
# 

# ## Some of the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists include:
# 
# 1. **Pandas:** A powerful library in Python for data manipulation and analysis, providing data structures and functions to work with structured data.
# 
# 2. **NumPy:** Fundamental package for scientific computing in Python, offering support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices along with a collection of mathematical functions.
# 
# 3. **Scikit-learn:** An essential machine learning library in Python that provides simple and efficient tools for data mining, analysis, and building predictive models.
# 
# 4. **Matplotlib:** A widely used plotting library in Python for creating visualizations, histograms, scatter plots, etc., allowing data scientists to visualize their data and results.
# 
# 5. **TensorFlow:** An open-source machine learning framework developed by Google, useful for building and training neural network models.
# 
# 6. **Keras:** High-level neural networks API, often used in conjunction with TensorFlow, enabling fast experimentation and prototyping of deep learning models.
# 
# 7. **PyTorch:** Another popular open-source machine learning framework, known for its flexibility and ease of use, especially for building and training deep neural networks.
# 
# 8. **Seaborn:** Built on top of Matplotlib, Seaborn provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
# 
# 9. **SciPy:** A collection of mathematical algorithms and convenience functions built on NumPy, offering additional functionalities for optimization, integration, linear algebra, etc.

### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python


result = 10 + 5
print(result)
result1 = 20 - 8
print(result1) 
result2 = 7 * 4
print(result2)  
result3 = 7 * 4
print(result3)  
result4 = 15 / 3
print(result4)  
result5 = 2 ** 3
print(result5)  
result6 = 17 % 5
print(result6) 



# In[4]:


(3*4)+5 #This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers


# In[5]:


minutes = 200

# Conversion to hours
hours = minutes / 60 #This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60
print(f"{minutes} minutes is equal to {hours} hours")


# **Objectives:**
# 
# - List popular languages used in Data Science.
# - Explore commonly used libraries for Data Science tasks.
# - Introduce tools and development environments for Data Science.
# - Demonstrate arithmetic expression examples in Python.
# - Convert minutes to hours using Python code.
